  "If you have a fishing rod or a wet suit, you can fish or dive and have a lot of fun down there..",
  "It's so relaxing to just listen to the waves and walk along the beach collecting seashells!",
  "I think decorating a room with seashells can make for very interesting interior design!",
  "My mom recently sent me a box with a cherry inside. Actually, she sent 3! And she specifically told me I should share them with people because that's what good puppies do.",

If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.",
  "Action is a great restorer and builder of confidence. Inaction is not only the result, but the cause, of fear. Perhaps the action you take will be successful; perhaps different action or adjustments will have to follow. But any action is better than no action at all.",
  "Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.",
  "Truth is, I'll never know all there is to know about you just as you will never know all there is to know about me. People are by nature too complicated to be understood fully. So, we can choose either to approach our fellow human beings with suspicion or to approach them with an open mind, a dash of optimism and a great deal of candour.",
  "Please take this sapling!",
  "Mmm, well then...",
  "Wow! So exciting!",
  "This is just like camping, isn't it?! It reminds me a lot of my childhood! Everyone would get all worked up, and we'd roast marshmallows and make popcorn over the fire... We'd always burn the popcorn a bit, but you know something? That just made it extra delicious!",
  "Oh no! I've gotten all carried away again. I'm so sorry!",
  "Well, that's all from me this time!",
  "If you're troubled about what to do, I could give you some advice! However, I might need to get really detailed and talk for long periods of time..",
  "Wow! Really?! You must be really efficient when it comes to moving!",
  "Sorry! Please don't tell my brother! I don't let him into my room for just this reason!",

  "Thanks for having me!",
  "OK! I can give you advice on how to make the most of your life!",
  "If you see people from town walking around, feel free to stop them for a chat!",

  "If you happen to go down to the beach and remember that, it would be a nice thing to do... for me.",

  "It would make me really happy if you'd pick me up a seashell as a souvenir of your little trip there...",
  "Oh my! You actually remembered to bring me a seashell?! Thank you so much! I'll put it in my room and take good care of it!",
  "I hear there are people who grow a lot of rare fruits like these in order to make a nice living for themselves.",
  "If you bring your shovel here, I can teach you how to plant trees, plus do some other nifty tricks!",
  "First, use your shovel to dig a hole where you'd like to plant your tree.",
  "Somewhere like in the shadow of a building or too close to another tree or nect to a river or next to a cliff..",
  "When you choose a place to plant a tree, make sure you give it plenty of space to grow!",
  "If you have a shovel, you can bury things, but you can also dig up things that were previously buried. Bork!",
  "Do you by any chance know how to dig things up?",
  "I can teach you if you'd like.",
  "Why don't we talk about some of the things people do for fun in our town?",
  "Fish and bugs.",
  "It's more than a hobby. Everyone around here makes a lot of money catching fish and bugs...",
  "Why don't you use this as an opportunity to make your fishing debut?",
  "Show me your encyclopedia!",
  "Good luck!",
  "How's the fishing going?",
  "Oh dear me...",
  "That is indeed a problem...",
  "Stand near the water's edge. If you see a fish's shadow, aim near it, press A, and cast your bobber. That's a metaphor!",
  "It looks like... I'm not sure what it looks like.",
  "If you give water to flowers you see, even wilted ones will be happy and perk up again the next day.",
  "I don't know if you have an interest in gardening, but... I really hope you'll use that watering can!",
  "Enjoy living the life you most want!",
  "I'll continue to be here to support you to the best of my ability.",
  "I hope I can help you for many more years to come!",
  "According to a recent citizen survey, your approval rating is 100 percent! Wow!",
  "Treat yo self",

  "And that's why I've STILL never been there.",
  "Did I digress a bit there? Sorry, sorry! Back to business then...",
  "Today from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. is the **Bug-Off!** You can find out more over at the even plaza.",
  "Zzzzzz.... AHHHHH! It's not what it looks like! OK, it's exactly what it looks like... But I was dreaming about work! I promise!",
  "I was really hoping you'd say that!",
  "Yay! Let's go find a place to build!",
  "I think not.. Sorry!",
